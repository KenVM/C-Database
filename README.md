# C-Database

The goal of this project is to create my own database using the C language.

For this project we will assume a webshop where we try to organize data into meaningful relationships and we focus for the purposes of this project on 3 entities: Users, Products and Purchases.

1. Define the Data Model:

USERS
- user_id
- name
- email

PRODUCTS
- product_id
- name
- price

PURCHASES
- purchase_id
- user_id
- product_id
- quantity

2. File Structure:

users.db (here we will store all user records)
products.db (here we will store all product records)
purchases.db (here we will store all purchase records)
